# Plotly Interactive Scatter Plot
This plot explores the relationship between car mileage per gallon and weight, colored by the number of cylinders.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(plotly)
library(tidyverse)

plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, color = ~factor(cyl),
        type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers') %>%
  layout(title = "Mileage vs. Weight by Cylinders",
         xaxis = list(title = "Weight (1000 lbs)"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Mileage per Gallon"))

```
